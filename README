# beermongerer

beermongerer scrapes my favorite Portland bottle shop's website every night. Yum.

# Installation

Replace config/s3config.bogus.rb with config/s3config.rb, containing your s3 authentication values. Also, replace all the copy, and probably the scraper in lib/tasks/cron.rake, unless you're scraping the same site I am. Upload to heroku.
